TicTacToe (LogicSphere Studio)

Why did I make it?

This is a simple TicTacToe game with UI I've made in C# using .NET Framework (WinForms App).
I've created this for a project in college where we were a team and had to create a website for a fictional company and attach some "personal projects" that the company would have.
The team was structured in 4 people where 2 were doing the website (in WordPress), 1 was managing social media and me who had to do the projects I was talking about.

What have you learned?

Thanks to this project I've learned how to structure my code in functions, how to manipulate C# WinForms graphic objects (buttons, PictureBoxes, labels, timers etc.).
In addition, I've learned how to design my app in multiple forms making the code cleaner and how to search for what I need both in OpenAI and sites (such as StackOverflow).

What tech did you use?

I've used just Visual Studio Code 2022 to code the entire app in C# .NET Framework, WinForms App.

What went well?

I think the thing that went best was structuring the code in multiple functions instead of throwing all of it in just a few.

What went poorly?

Definetly the way I've managed the button. I'm sure I could've found a better way that Enabling/Disabling them continously.
